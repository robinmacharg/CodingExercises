## Challenge #1

After clicking a button 3 times, with at least one second elapsed between each click, print 
“Challenge #1 solved” to the browser console once. Further clicks will not have any effects.

## Challenge #2
Make an ajax call to an API to fetch some data, retry the call up to 3 time in case of failure, 
but allowing 2 seconds to elapse between each ajax call. If the three calls fail, write “API call 
failed” to the browser console , if any of them succeed, show the retrieved data instead.

## Challenge #3
Filter an array based on user input in a textbox as the user types, but wait one second 
before triggering the filtering, and display the filtered array in the browser console.
