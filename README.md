# CodingExercises

This repository contains collected coding exercises from various job applications.

Each exercise is in its own subdirectory and contains READMEs explaining the intention.

Each task has typically been submitted in its own repo.  For simplicity commit histories have been elided.  Ones I really enjoyed are marked with a ⭐️.
