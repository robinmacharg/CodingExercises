# Moneybox iOS Technical Challenge

**Please see the submission README [here](README_submission.md) for a full explanation of the solution.**

## The Brief

To create a 'light' version of the Moneybox app that will allow existing users to login and check their account balance, as well as viewing their Moneybox savings. 
- To fork this repository to your private repository and implement the solution.
 
### The app should have
- A login screen to allow existing users to sign in
- A screen to show the accounts the user holds, e.g. ISA, GIA
- A screen to show some details of the account, including a simple button to add money to its moneybox.
- The button will add a fixed amount of Â£10. It should use the `POST /oneoffpayments` endpoint provided, and the account's Moneybox amount would be updated.

A prototype wireframe of all 3 screens is provided as a guideline. You are free to provide additional information if you wish.

### What we are looking for
 - **Showcase what you can do. It can be a refined UI, or enhanced UX, or use of specific design patterns in the code, or anything that can make the project stand out.**
 - Demonstration of coding style, conventions and patterns.
 - A tidy code organisation.
 - Use of autolayout (preferably UIKit).
 - Implementation of unit tests.
 - Any accessibility feature would be a bonus.
 - The application must run on iOS 13 or later.
 - Any 3rd party library should be integrated using Swift Package Manager.

### API Usage
The Networking methods and Models for requests and responses are ready-made in the Networking module of the project.

#### Base URL & Test User
The base URL for the moneybox sandbox environment is `https://api-test02.moneyboxapp.com/`. </br>
You can log in using the following user:

|  Username          | Password         |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| test+ios2@moneyboxapp.com  | P455word12  |

#### Authentication
You should obtain a bearer token from the Login response, and attach it as an Authorization header for the endpoints. Helper methods in the API/Base folder should be used for that.
(Note: The BearerToken has a sliding expiration of 5 mins).

| Key  |  Value  |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Authorization |  Bearer TsMWRkbrcu3NGrpf84gi2+pg0iOMVymyKklmkY0oI84= |

#### API Call Hint

```
let dataProvider = DataProvider()
dataProvider.login(request: request, completion: completion)
```
request: Initialize your request model </br>
Completion: Handle your API success and failure cases

## Unit Tests
The MoneyBoxTests folder includes stubbed data to easily mock the responses needed for unit testing

#### Usage Hint
You can create a DataProviderMock class via inject DataProviderLogic protocol </br>
You can mock response in Login.json file like this:
```
StubData.read(file: "Login", callback: completion)
```

### How to Submit your solution:
 - To share your Github repository with the user valerio-bettini.
 - (Optional) Provide a readme in markdown which outlines your solution.

## Good luck!
