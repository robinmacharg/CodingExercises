## Artchitecture/Coding Style
### MVC vs MVVM vs MVP vs VIPER

MVVM + (Functional) Reactive

### Singletons.  Alternatives (DI)
### Declarative vs Imperative


## Async, Promises
### async/await
### actors

## Leaks/Memory management, weak/strong, detecting cycles

## O(Complexity)

## UIKit, SwiftUI

## Reactive - RxSwift, ReactiveUI, Combine

## SOLID

- **Single-Responsibility Principle**  Each and every class in your project should have one, and only one responsibility.
- **Open-Closed Principle** Entities in your software system should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
- **Liskov Substitution Principle** Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it.
- **Interface Segregation Principle** Clients should not have to implement interfaces that they donâ€™t use.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle** High level modules should not depend on lower level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

## Language features

### Codable/JSON encoding

```

```

### Enum

Errors: 
```
enum CustomError: Error {
    case anError
    case unexpected(message: String)
}
```

### Singleton

```
class Foo {
    static let shared = Foo()
    private init() {}
}
```

### Generics

Generics vs Opaque types - `some` keyword

### Protocol oriented



### Extensions
### Class vs Structs

Inheritance, ObjC interop, Single Instance requirement

### Mutating
### Type constraints with `where`
### Rich Switch
### Functional - `map`, `reduce`, `zip`, `filter`
### Codable 
### Property Decorators
### Subscript Syntax

keys, nested, custom (non-JSON) formats

## Thread safety
- **Race Conditions** 2 or more concurrent accesses to shared data.
- **Deadlock** 2 or more threads waiting for locks to be released.
  
### Mitigations
- Dispatch Barriers
- Dispatch Queue
- Dispatch Semaphore - scquire semaphore, wait to be notified it's OK to access resource.
- NSLock - Acquire lock.  Can cause deadlocks.
- Alternatives to threads: NSOperation, GCD, Async, timer
- TODO: Apple's threading docs.

## Build/Deploy
### Bitcode
### Signing
### Deployment
#### Fastlane
#### Firebase

### Development Environment

- Xcode vs AppCode
- `xcodeselect`
- `xcprofile`
- 

### Package Management
Cocoapods vs. Carthage vs SPM

## Design Patterns
- DI/Service Provider
- Observer
  (Own implementation with introspection)
- Command
- Singleton
  - Valid vs. Invalid cases.  API, DB, Application, Cache?
- Factory
- Adapter



## Testing
### Unit

Unit vs. UI.  Coverage.  Pragmatism.  Death by a thousand swipes.

### CI

## Literate coding

Comments at the Why level.  Playgrounds to highlight features (with `/*: ... */` docs).  Build targets to automate N-offs (localisation, asset compilation, cocoapods (but see also Git hooks)).  Markdown comments.

List processing (``foreach {}`) vs `for/in`. Pragmatic clarity.
