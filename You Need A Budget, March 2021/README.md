# You Need A Budget

Given two integer arrays, return a string detailing members of each array that are not present in the other.  The inputs are assumed to contain unique members but have no guarantee of order.

## To Run

Open the Xcode project and hit run.  The code is in a single ViewController and output is to the console.  Could (*should*) be a playground or console app but an iOS app was asked for.
